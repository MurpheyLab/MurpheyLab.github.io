We are excited to have [Zixin Zhang](https://murpheylab.github.io/people/zixinzhang) join the lab! Zixin is a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering. Previously, he has done research related to trajectory optimization and MPC, and has worked quite a bit with quadrupedal robots. He will be a terrific addition to our team.

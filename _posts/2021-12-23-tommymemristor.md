This joint work with our collaborators from MIT, titled [*Memristor Circuits for Colloidal Robotics: Temporal Access to Memory, Sensing, and Actuation*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aisy.202100205), has come out in Advanced Intelligent Systems. This computational study shows how memristor-based circuits will be crucial to the future of microrobotics.

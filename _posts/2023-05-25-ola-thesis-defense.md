Ola Kalinowska defended her PhD thesis (‘Human-Machine Communication in Assistive and Rehabilitation Robotics’). She is a genuinely inspiring lab member, and her thesis work spans various aspects of human-machine communication, from robot-assistive physical therapy to reinforcement learning. We will miss Ola, and we are excited for her new journey at Google’s [X, the moonshot factory](https://x.company/)!

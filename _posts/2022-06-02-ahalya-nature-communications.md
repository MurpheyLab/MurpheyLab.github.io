Our new paper titled "[Mechanical Intelligence For Learning Embodied Sensor-Object Relationships](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31795-2)" is out on Nature Communications. It shows how active data collection can enable use of novel sensors for perception. A high-level introduction of the paper can be found at this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/todd_murphey/status/1547954357563363328) and this [blog](https://engineeringcommunity.nature.com/posts/where-will-all-the-data-come-from).
